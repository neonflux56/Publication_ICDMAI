India is an extremely populous country with a
massive population of 1.2 billion residents, and a large
proportion of people with disabilities in both rural and urban
India. Speech impairment is common with people with hearing
loss since birth. Among the total disabled population, about 27%
have movement constraints and hence are confined to
wheelchairs. This paper proposes the idea of using machine
learning implementation to develop a device that can benefit the
speech and motion constrained population. Gesture control plays
an essential role in order to convert the sensor data into speech
output or operating a pick and place bot for the motion
constrained. Various algorithms are interfaced with the device to
provide efficient functionality and throughput. Machine learning
and data analytics technologies have been on the rise recently and
are finding applications in various domains and industries.
